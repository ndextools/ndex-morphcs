# Operation

The operation is mandatory and is used to state which operation to perform.  A single keyword designates the 
operation.  There are presently only two valid keywords, and they are case-insensitive.  That is 'tocsv' is the
same as 'TOCSV' and 'ToCsv'... and so on.

The valid operation keyword values are:
* tocsv
* totsv

### tocsv → Outputs to a comma separated value (csv) format

A comma is used to separate column values.

### totsv → Outputs to a tab separated value (tsv) format

Column values are separated by a tab character.
