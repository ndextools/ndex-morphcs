PDPK1	up-regulates	AKT	uniprot:O15530		protein	signor:SIGNOR-PF24		proteinfamily	pubmed:12808134	lperfetto		YES	phosphorylation	Thr308	Akt1 and akt2 are phosphorylated and activated by the protein kinase pdk1 at thr-308 or thr-309, respectively, in the activation t-loop, and further activation occurs through phosphorylation at ser-473 or ser-474, respectively. In this paper, we demonstrate that this is indeed the case, and report the purification and initial characterization of a 3 phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase, pdk1, which activates pkb by phosphorylating it at thr308. Akt is directly phosphorylated and activated by pdk1. Akt/pkb activation requires the phosphorylation of thr308 in the activation loop by the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (pdk1).
